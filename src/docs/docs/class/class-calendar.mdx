# Class Calendar

This page will show you a calendar view, either by month or week, of the upcoming Classes offered.

- The Classes are coloured so any multi-day Class can be easily recongized.
- You can select a Class to see a dialog pop up which shows all the Class dates and available spots.
- The primary coloured person icons are filled spots.
- The unique coloured person icon is you.

The register button will only be active when you are allowed to register to the Class.
Cases where you are not able to register to the Class include:

- You have previously unregistered from this Class.
- You are registered to another Class for the same Course.
- The Class is within 48 hours to start.

You can unregister from a Class, but keep in mind that you will **not be able** to register to that particular Class again. Sorry for this inconvenience.
