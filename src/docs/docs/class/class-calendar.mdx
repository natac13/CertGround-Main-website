# Class Calendar

1. This page will show you a calendar view, either by month or week, of the upcoming Classes offered.
2. The Classes are coloured so any multi-day Class can be easily recongized.
3. You can select a Class to see a dialog pop up which shows all the Class dates and available spots.
4. You will see a person icon coloured green for when a spot is filled.
5. If the person icon is yellow that represents you!
6. The register button will only be active when you are allowed to register to the Class.
7. Cases where you are not able to register to the Class include:

- You have previously unregistered from this Class.
- You are registered to another Class for the same Course.
- The Class is within 48 hours to start.

8. You can unregister from a Class, but keep in mind that you will not be able to register to that particular Class again. Sorry for this inconvenience.
