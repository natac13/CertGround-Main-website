## Course vs Class

To understand the terms **Course** and **Class** in the context of CertGround™, think back to highschool, where you attended _classes_ to complete a _course_. This is the same concept I have used with CertGround™S, where a member attends a one day, or multi-day Class to become certified in a Course that is offered by the organization the member in question belongs to.

To complete a Course and receive the certification a member must attend the Class(es) required and be successful with training and testing provided.
