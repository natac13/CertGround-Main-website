# Member Profile Page

On the Member Profile page you will be able to see the following.

1. A progress bar that will show you how many courses you have completed out of the number that is offered by your Hall.
2. Below that there is a list of Course Tiles showing the Course Type, Skill or Safety, the Course Name, and the expiry date for that Course.

- The Course Tile will have an orange border and show a 6 month warning message when that time has passed.
- The Course Tile will have a red border and show a Expiry Warning message when your Course has expired.

3. You can filter the Course Tile list by **All**, **Skills**, **Safety** and **Available**.
4. Available Courses are ones that you have yet to take a Class in or the Course has gone expired.
5. Selecting a Course Tile while in the **All**, **Skills** and **Safety** list views, you will see a list of your historical dates trained.
6. Selection a Course Tile while in the **Available** list view, will take you to the Class Registration Calendar View. There you can view upcoming Classes with the ability to register and unregister from those Classes.
