# Certifcation Share on CertGround&trade;

You have the following 2 options referenced below to share your completed Course Certificates with a Safety Coordinator when you are completing the new hire paper work.

On both pages you will see a list of your Courses. Dulled Courses are ones that are expired; and therefore cannot be shared. You can select which Courses you want to share.

## QRCode Cert Share

With the QRCode Cert Share:

- When you click Generate QRCode, a dialog window will pop up with the QRCode, and 2 buttons.
- One to "Go To" the Share Cert View page showing your selected Course Certificates.
- The other will copy that link to your clipboard so that you can paste it in a SMS text message or email for you to share with anyone.

## Email Cert Share

With the Email Cert Share:

- You will select your Courses like above but will be required to enter in the email address of the person getting the Course Certificate Verification.
- Next a dialog pop up will appear for you to type in (no pasting) the email address again. This is to ensure you have the correct email as any email sent to an unknown address will cause your account to receive a 4 hour email ban.
- If you send an email to a unknown address twice in one month you will be blacklisted from sending emails. Please use the QRCode Cert Share at that point.
- The Email Cert Share is limited to 3 emails per week. This is to maintain usage limits and encourage the use of the QRCode Cert Share.
